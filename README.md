# Stutter Diagnosis and Therapy System based on Deep Learning: 

Reproduce result of paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08003 on own in house created dataset including speaker of varying age and gender

This project intends to deliver an affordable personalized stuttering therapy to people who stutter. The main objective of this project is
to improve personâ€™s speech fluency by accurately diagnosing stutter and then suggesting appropriate training exercises for practice

This work attempts to detect and classify stutters in the input audio while existing works focus only on detection of stutters.  We have used Gated Recurrent CNN on MFCC audio features for stutter detection and classification.SVM-based system that can suggest therapies based on the type and severity of the stuttering.
